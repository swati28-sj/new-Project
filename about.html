        <p align="center" style="padding:20px 10px; margin: 20px;">The aim of our project is to ease the current food delivery system in place. We intended to automatize the process and
          make it easy for both the canteen staff, faculty members and students. We developed a systematic online food ordering system
           which can be used by the faculty members and students to order items quickly. Also the order details are stored in the
           database. Complete canteen details is managed using the website.Customerâ€™s orders can be managed using the website.
           This website is for existing customers of the site. The registered users can login and view the available
            food items and can place order. New customers have to register themselves to access the website .</p>
          <p align="center" style="padding:20px 10px; margin: 20px;">It can be made use for daily & monthly food planning purpose. It facilitates canteen manager to take the daily food
           planning report. Usage of this Canteen Management System allows canteen manager to track food consumption of each customer
           over a period of time, prevents wastage of food and eliminates errors in accounting. By just integrating shift details
           along with breakfast, lunch and dinner timings different types of reports can be taken with respect to customer food
           consumption and with respect to daily sales by the canteen.Users can also trace their monthly expenditure on food.</p>
           <p align="center" style="padding:20px 10px; margin: 20px;">It allows secure and speedy transactions. It helps management to handle the users by reducing the waiting time for the
           queues.Any person visiting college can place order by using the website.</p>
           <p align="center" style="padding:20px 10px; margin: 20px;">Canteen Management System is used to place the food orders and has two parts to it, namely the admin side and user side.
              Admin can select the items for the day and also perform functionalities like adding user, removing user, adding food
              items, removing food items, also look at the current orders block wise.
